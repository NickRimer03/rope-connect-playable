## HowTo

### Run the game

Simply run `build/index.html`

### Play

This playable is a variation of the playable from [another repository](https://github.com/NickRimer03/drawer-playable).

Use your mouse (on desktop) or finger (on mobile) to start drawing a rope.

Connect the three pieces with two separate ropes in turn.

You cannot connect two different tiles. You cannot connect two identical pieces if the rope crosses another piece. Going out of bounds will also stop drawing.

After a few seconds of inactivity, the hint will highlight a random trio of available chips.
